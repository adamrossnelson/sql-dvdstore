# ðŸŽ“ General Beginner SQL Challenges

Welcome to this larger general challenge. This is designed to help you apply what you've learned so far. Each challenge includes:

- A realistic task or business question
- A short hint section to guide you (optionalâ€”skip it if you want to try on your own)
- A full solution at the end of each challenge

Donâ€™t hesitate to break each problem into small parts. If you get stuck, look back at earlier lessons (before turning to other tools including GenAI).

## Challenge 1: Total High-Value Rentals

Your first business task is this:

**How many rental transactions involved a payment of more than $8.00?**

Take a moment to try writing this query yourself.

---

### Hint

To solve this, youâ€™ll need to:

- Query the `payment` table
- Use the `COUNT()` function to count rows
- Filter rows using `WHERE` with a comparison operator (`>`)

Find the solution at the bottom of this tutorial.

## Challenge 2: Last Names Ending in 'son'

The next challenge is this:

**How many customers have a last name that ends in "son"?**

This name ending is common in many regions (like names ending in "Johnson", "Anderson", "Nelson", etc.), and your manager is curious if thereâ€™s a pattern.

---

### Hint

Youâ€™ll need to:

* Use the `customer` table
* Use `COUNT(*)`
* Use the `LIKE` operator with a wildcard to match names that end in "son"

Find the solution at the bottom of this tutorial.

## Challenge 3: Film Titles with Exactly 12 Characters

Your next task:

**How many films have a title that is exactly 12 characters long?**

---

### Hint

To solve this, youâ€™ll need:

* The `film` table
* The `LENGTH()` function
* A `WHERE` clause with a comparison operator (`=`)

Find the solution at the bottom of this tutorial.

## Challenge 4: Customers with First Names Starting with 'K' or 'L'

Your final challenge for this beginner tutorial sequence:

**How many customers have a first name that starts with either the letter 'K' or the letter 'L'?**

---

### Hint

Youâ€™ll need:

* The `customer` table
* The `LIKE` operator used twice
* The `OR` logical operator

Find the solution at the bottom of this tutorial.

---

### Challenge 1: Solution

```sql
SELECT COUNT(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 8.00;
```

This query returns the number of payment transactions where the amount was greater than \$8.00.

---

### Challenge 2: Solution

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM customer
WHERE last_name LIKE '%son';
```

The `%` wildcard matches any number of characters before the `"son"` ending.

---

### Challenge 3: Solution

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM film
WHERE LENGTH(title) = 12;
```

This query filters films where the title is exactly 12 characters long.

---

### Challenge 4: Solution

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'K%'
   OR first_name LIKE 'L%';
```

This query matches first names that start with either 'K' or 'L' by combining two `LIKE` patterns.
