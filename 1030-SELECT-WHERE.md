# ðŸŽ“ Tutorial: Using SELECT ... WHERE in SQLite

## What Is SELECT ... WHERE?

In SQLite, the `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a table, and the `WHERE` clause is used to filter that data based on specific conditions. Together, they let you ask questions like:

- Which customers prefer tea?
- Which movies are rated 'PG-13'?
- Which rentals occurred after a specific date?

These are the most commonly used SQL clauses and appear in nearly every query you'll write.

The basic syntax looks like this:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

The `WHERE` clause appears immediately after the `FROM` clause and filters the rows returned based on the given condition.

## Comparison Operators

In most cases, youâ€™ll want to compare values using standard operators. These are the same concepts you may have seen Python or R, Excel, or other programmatic contexts (though the syntax may vary).

| Operator | Meaning                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `=`      | Equals                   |
| `!=`     | Not equal                |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |

These allow you to create filters like:

* Where the beverage is equal to 'Tea'
* Where the rating is not equal to 'R'
* Where the price is greater than 2.99

## Logical Operators

You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators These behave similarly to what you're familiar with in Python or R and again other programmtic contexts.

| Operator | Meaning                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `AND`    | Both conditions must be true        |
| `OR`     | At least one condition must be true |
| `NOT`    | Negates the condition that follows  |

## Example: Filtering Beverage Choices

Letâ€™s go back to our hypothetical `beverage_preferences` table:

| customer\_name | favorite\_beverage |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Alex           | Tea                |
| Jordan         | Coffee             |
| Morgan         | Tea                |
| Casey          | Water              |
| Alex           | Juice              |

### Query 1: Select all rows where the favorite beverage is Tea

This query would be useful if you had a special promotion for tea drinkers. You could use it to send them a coupon or email blast.

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
WHERE favorite_beverage = 'Tea';
```

### Query 2: Select all rows where the beverage is not Water

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
WHERE favorite_beverage != 'Water';
```

### Query 3: Select rows where the beverage is either Tea or Coffee

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
WHERE favorite_beverage = 'Tea' OR favorite_beverage = 'Coffee';
```

## Challenge 1

You are a database specialist at a DVD rental store. Your manager wants to identify all movies that are suitable for general audiences. In the Sakila database, the `film` table includes a column called `rating`.

Your task:

1. Write a query to return the `title` and `rating` of all films where the rating is `'G'`.
2. Test your query using SQLite and the Sakila database.

Once you're ready, scroll down to the heading:

## Challenge 2

Now your manager wants to find all longer films that might be better suited for older audiences. The `film` table includes a column called `length` (in minutes) and another column called `rating`.

Your task:

1. Write a query to return the `title`, `length`, and `rating` of all films that are **over 120 minutes long** and rated either `'PG-13'` or `'R'`.
2. Test your query using SQLite.

When you're done, scroll down to:

## Summary

* Use `SELECT ... WHERE` to filter rows from a table based on specific conditions.
* Combine conditions with comparison operators like `=`, `!=`, `<`, and `>`.
* Use logical operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to form more complex queries.
* The `WHERE` clause is one of the most important tools in writing meaningful SQL.

## Challenge Solution 1

```sql
SELECT title, rating
FROM film
WHERE rating = 'G';
```

This returns all films rated for general audiences.

---

## Challenge Solution 2

```sql
SELECT title, length, rating
FROM film
WHERE length > 120
  AND (rating = 'PG-13' OR rating = 'R');
```

This returns all films over 120 minutes long that are rated PG-13 or R.

```
