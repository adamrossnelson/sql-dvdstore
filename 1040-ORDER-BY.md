# ðŸŽ“ Tutorial: Using ORDER BY in SQLite

## What Is ORDER BY?

In SQLite, the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set of a query based on one or more columns. This allows you to organize data in a meaningful way, such as alphabetically by name, chronologically by date, or numerically by price.

You can sort in either ascending (lowest to highest) or descending (highest to lowest) order.

---

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];
```

Use `ASC` for ascending order and `DESC` for descending order. If no order is specified, SQLite uses ascending order by default.

---

## Default Order: ASC vs DESC

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what each keyword does:

* `ASC` (ascending): A to Z, 0 to 9, earliest to latest
* `DESC` (descending): Z to A, 9 to 0, latest to earliest

You can specify the order like this:

```sql
ORDER BY price ASC;
```

or

```sql
ORDER BY release_year DESC;
```

## Practical Example: Sorting Results

Letâ€™s work with our `beverage_preferences` table again:

| customer\_name | favorite\_beverage |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Alex           | Tea                |
| Jordan         | Coffee             |
| Morgan         | Tea                |
| Casey          | Water              |
| Alex           | Juice              |

### Sort beverages alphabetically

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
ORDER BY favorite_beverage;
```

This returns beverages in alphabetical order.

### Sort beverages in reverse alphabetical order

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
ORDER BY favorite_beverage DESC;
```

---

## Sorting By Multiple Columns

You can also sort by more than one column. This is helpful when there are duplicate values in the first column and you want a secondary sort order.

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
ORDER BY favorite_beverage ASC, customer_name DESC;
```

This first sorts by `favorite_beverage` A to Z, and if multiple people have the same favorite, it sorts their names Z to A.

---

## ORDER BY with WHERE

You can combine `ORDER BY` with `WHERE` to filter and sort in the same query.

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
WHERE favorite_beverage != 'Water'
ORDER BY customer_name ASC;
```

This filters out anyone who chose water and then sorts the rest by name.

Yesâ€”great observation! Since all movies in the Sakila dataset have a `release_year` of 2006, sorting by that column doesnâ€™t produce any meaningful variation.

Here's a better challenge that makes use of the `ORDER BY` clause with more useful variation in the Sakila data:

---

##  Challenge

Youâ€™re working as a database specialist for a DVD rental store. Your manager wants to better understand the inventory by identifying the longest movies in the collection.

In the Sakila database, the `film` table includes a column called `length`, which represents the duration of each movie in minutes.

Your task is to:

1. Write a query to return the `title` and `length` (and any other columns you think are relevant) of all films - During testing you might consider use of the `limit` clause to limit the number of results returned.
2. Sort the results so the longest movies appear first.
3. Test your query using SQLite and the Sakila database.

When youâ€™re ready, scroll down to see the solution at the bottom of this tutorial.

## Summary

* Use `ORDER BY` to sort query results by one or more columns.
* Default sort order is ascending (`ASC`).
* Use `DESC` to reverse the order.
* Combine `ORDER BY` with `WHERE` to filter and sort results.
* Use multiple columns for layered sorting.

---

## Challenge Solution

```sql
SELECT title, length
FROM film
ORDER BY length DESC;
```

This query returns all films sorted by duration from longest to shortest.
