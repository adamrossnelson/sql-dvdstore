# ðŸŽ“ Tutorial: Using COUNT in SQLite

## What Is COUNT?

In SQLite, the `COUNT` function is used to return the number of rows that match a given condition. It's one of the most useful tools for quickly summarizing data and answering questions like:

- How many records are in this table?
- How many customers made a rental?
- How many unique categories are there?

The basic syntax looks like this:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;
```

Or, to count values in a specific column:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

> [!NOTE]
> `COUNT` requires parentheses because it is a function. Unlike some keywords that work with or without parentheses (like `DISTINCT`), `COUNT` will not work without them.

## Practical Example: Counting Rows

Letâ€™s reuse our earlier example of a table called `beverage_preferences` that tracks customer drink choices.

| customer\_name | favorite\_beverage |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Alex           | Tea                |
| Jordan         | Coffee             |
| Morgan         | Tea                |
| Casey          | Water              |
| Alex           | Juice              |

If we want to know how many rows are in this table, we can run:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM beverage_preferences;
```

This will return:

```
5
```

Because there are 5 rows total.

We can also count a specific column, like:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(customer_name)
FROM beverage_preferences;
```

Or:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(favorite_beverage)
FROM beverage_preferences;
```

All of these will return the same resultâ€”`5`â€”since each row has a value in both columns.

## When to Use COUNT(column\_name)

Even though `COUNT(*)` is most common, sometimes it's helpful to use a specific column name. This can make your query easier to understand later when reviewing your code.

In some cases, you might want to count only non-null values in a column. Unlike `COUNT(*)`, which includes every row, `COUNT(column_name)` ignores rows where the column is `NULL`.

## Challenge

Imagine you work at a DVD rental store and your manager wants to know how many rental transactions have occurred overall. They want a quick summary of the total number of times any customer has rented a filmâ€”regardless of what movie or who the customer was.

In the Sakila database, the `rental` table tracks each rental transaction, and each row in that table represents one rental.

Your task:

1. Write a query that uses `COUNT` to return the total number of rental transactions.
2. Use either `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(rental_id)`â€”they should return the same value.
3. Test your query in SQLite using the `sakila.db` database.

When you're ready, scroll down to see the answer under the heading:

## Summary

* The `COUNT` function returns the number of rows that match a query.
* Use `COUNT(*)` to count all rows, or `COUNT(column_name)` to count non-null values in a specific column.
* Parentheses are required when using `COUNT`.
* Useful for totals, summaries, and understanding the size of a dataset.

## Challenge Solution

To count the total number of rental transactions from the `rental` table, use:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM rental;
```

Or:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(rental_id)
FROM rental;
```

Both queries return the same result, since `rental_id` is a required, non-null field for each row in the table.

A plausible business use case for this query is to understand the total number of rental transactions in the storeâ€™s collection. On your own, consider what other business questions this query might help answer. What other counts might be useful to know for you or your manager?
