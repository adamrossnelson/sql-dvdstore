# üìÄ Getting Started with the Sakila Database using SQLite3

Welcome! This tutorial will guide you through accessing and exploring the "Sakila" database using the `sqlite3` command-line interface (CLI). Read more about this data here in this repository's [Data Acknodlwedgement](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/sql-dvdstore/blob/main/DataAcknowledgement.md).

## üçé How To Use This Resource

This repository contains a series of tutorial files organized in a progressive learning path for SQL beginners. Here's how to make the most of these resources:

1. **Start with the basics**: If you're completely new to SQL or need a refresher on setting up SQLite, visit the [SQL Sandbox repository](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/sql-sandbox) first for a lower-level introduction.

2. **Follow the numbered tutorials**: The files are numbered (1010, 1020, etc.) to guide you through SQL concepts in a logical order, from basic queries to more complex filtering and sorting.

3. **Hands-on practice**: For each concept, try the example queries using the included `sakila.db` database file. The best way to learn SQL is by writing and running your own queries.

4. **Complete the challenges**: Each tutorial includes challenges to test your understanding. Try solving these before looking at the provided solutions.

5. **Reference as needed**: Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can use these files as a quick reference for specific SQL techniques.

## üí° What Is the Sakila Database?

These data are fictional examples of a DVD rental store records. If you're not sure what DVDs are, you're not alone! Before streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, people used to rent movies on physical discs (called DVDs) from video rental stores.

Sakila simulates how one of those stores operated ‚Äî tracking customers, movie inventory, rentals, payments, and more.

Even though DVDs aren‚Äôt as common as they once were the data model is realistic and useful for learning SQL.

## üîß Step 1: Opening the Sakila Database in SQLite

You‚Äôll need:
- A terminal or command prompt
- SQLite installed on your machine
- The `sakila.db` file (make sure it‚Äôs in your current directory)

> [!NOTE]
> If you need an introduction to installing and getting oriented with SQLite check out the [SQL Sandbox repository](https://github.com/adamrossnelson/sql-sandbox).

To open the database, run:

```bash
sqlite3 sakila.db
```

You‚Äôll now be inside the `sqlite3` prompt. It looks like this:

```
sqlite>
```

## üìã Step 2: Turn Headers On

By default, SQLite doesn‚Äôt show column names when displaying results. Turn them on for easier reading:

```sql
.headers on
```

Also, for better formatting:

```sql
.mode column
```

Now your query results will look more like a table with column headers.

## üîç Step 3: Explore the Database Schema

To view all tables in the Sakila database:

```sql
.tables
```

You‚Äôll see table names like (among others):

```
actor           customer        film            inventory
category        payment         rental          staff
```

To see the structure (columns and types) of a specific table, use:

```sql
.schema film
```

The `.scheme film` command shows the structure of the `film` table, including column names and types. Notice that the CLI interface shows the structure by displaying SQL code that would recreate the table.

## üß† What Does the Sakila Data Represent?

A quick rundown of selected tables in these data:

| Table        | What It Represents                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `film`       | The movies available in the store                   |
| `inventory`  | Each physical DVD copy of each film                 |
| `rental`     | Every time a customer rents a DVD                   |
| `customer`   | People who signed up for a rental account           |
| `staff`      | Employees working at the store                      |
| `store`      | Physical store locations (yes, there were chains!)  |
| `payment`    | How customers paid for their rentals                |
| `actor`      | Actors starring in the films                        |
| `film_actor` | Which actors appeared in which films (many-to-many) |
| `category`   | Movie genres like Action, Comedy, Documentary, etc. |

## ‚úÖ Try It Out

Try this simple SQL query to see the first few movies:

```sql
SELECT film_id, title, release_year, rental_rate
FROM film
LIMIT 5;
```

Or list all customers:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM customer
LIMIT 5;
```

## üéâ You‚Äôre On Your Way!

You‚Äôve now opened a database, explored its structure, and inspected the data! The Sakila dataset may represent a business model that‚Äôs admmittedly no longer common remains apopular resource for learning how relational databases work.

Next step? Try writing some joins to combine tables and answer questions like:

* Which customers rented which movies?
* What are the most popular genres?
* How much revenue did each store make?

Happy querying!
