# ðŸŽ“ Tutorial: Using LIKE and ILIKE in SQLite

## What Is LIKE?

In SQLite, the `LIKE` operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. Itâ€™s helpful when you want to match part of a string rather than an exact value.

For example, you might want to find all customer names that start with the letter "A" or all movie titles that include the word "Love."

The `LIKE` operator works with **wildcards**:
- `%` matches any sequence of characters (including zero characters)
- `_` matches a single character

The `ILIKE` operator is similar to `LIKE`, but it is case-insensitive. This means that it will match a pattern regardless of the case of the characters in the pattern. For example, the pattern "alex" will match "Alex", "ALEX", "alex", and "Alex". Be sure to know for future reference that `ILIKE` is not a standard SQL operator, but it is supported by some SQL engines like PostgreSQL or Amazon Redshift.

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table_name
WHERE column1 LIKE 'pattern';
````

Examples:

```sql
-- Names that start with 'A'
WHERE customer_name LIKE 'A%'

-- Names that end in 'n'
WHERE customer_name LIKE '%n'

-- Names that contain 'son'
WHERE customer_name LIKE '%son%'

-- Names with 4 letters, ending in 'y'
WHERE customer_name LIKE '__y'
```

## Case Sensitivity and ILIKE

SQLite's `LIKE` operator is case-insensitive by default for ASCII characters. So:

```sql
WHERE customer_name LIKE 'alex'
```

will match `"Alex"` or `"ALEX"`.

However, if you are using a version of SQLite compiled with `LIKE` as case-sensitive (rare), or if you're switching to PostgreSQL later, you might see different behavior.

To be more explicit about case-insensitive matching, some SQL engines support the `ILIKE` operator (short for "insensitive LIKE"). While `ILIKE` is not built into SQLite by default, it can be mimicked using functions like `LOWER()`:

```sql
WHERE LOWER(customer_name) LIKE 'alex'
```

So even if you're moving between SQL engines, you can still achieve case-insensitive searches by normalizing text with `LOWER()`.

## Practical Example: Finding Beverages

Suppose we have our `beverage_preferences` table. Here is an expanded version from the versions shown in previous tutorials (Which now also includes both hot and cold beverages):

| customer\_name | favorite\_beverage |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Alex           | Iced Cold Tea      |
| Jordan         | Hot Coffee         |
| Morgan         | Tea Latte          |
| Casey          | Water              |
| Alex           | Orange Juice       |
| John           | Tea                |
| Susan          | Iced Cold Coffee   |
| Jamie          | Tea Latte          |
| Casey          | Water              |
| Josh           | Apple Juice        |


### Example 1: Find customers who chose a beverage with "Tea" in the name

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
WHERE favorite_beverage LIKE '%Cold%';
```

This matches "Iced Cold Tea" and "Iced Cold Coffee".

### Example 2: Case-insensitive version using LOWER()

```sql
SELECT customer_name, favorite_beverage
FROM beverage_preferences
WHERE LOWER(favorite_beverage) LIKE '%tea%';
```

This ensures you match "tea", "Tea", or "TEA" regardless of case.

## Challenge

Your manager at the DVD rental store wants to explore all movies whose titles include the word "action"â€”but they arenâ€™t sure how it was capitalized when entered into the database.

In the Sakila database, the `film` table contains the `title` column.

Your task:

1. Write a query that returns all titles that include the word "action", regardless of capitalization.
2. Use either `LIKE` or a combination of `LOWER()` and `LIKE`.
3. Test your query in SQLite.

When youâ€™re ready, scroll down to:

```
## Challenge Solution

## Summary

* Use `LIKE` to match patterns in text.
* `%` is a wildcard for any number of characters.
* `_` is a wildcard for a single character.
* SQLiteâ€™s `LIKE` is case-insensitive by default, but use `LOWER()` for compatibility.
* Use `ILIKE` in engines like PostgreSQL for explicitly case-insensitive pattern matching.

## Challenge Solution

```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%action%';
```

This query returns all film titles that include the word "action", regardless of how it was capitalized in the database. Also notice how these results also return a movie with the word "Attraction" or other words that include `action` as a substrgin of a larger word.

If your goal is to match the standalone word "action" rather than substrings, the solution becomes a bit trickier. SQLite does not have built-in support for whole-word boundaries in the LIKE operator. One workaround is to add spaces or punctuation around the target word in the search pattern. For example:

```sql
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '% action %'
   OR title LIKE 'action %'
   OR title LIKE '% action'
   OR title = 'action';
```

This approach tries to capture different word boundary scenarios:

- Titles where "action" appears in the middle, surrounded by spaces
- At the beginning or end of the title
- As the entire title

A plausible business related use case for this query would be identifying all films that include the word "action" in their title, which could support curating an "Action-Packed Titles" collection for display or promotion. But think about itâ€”are you only interested in movies explicitly labeled as "action" in the title, or might you unintentionally pull in titles like "Attraction" or "Distraction"? This query starts the process, but refining it helps you think critically about how search logic affects customer-facing results. On your own, consider how this technique might be adjusted to build collections around other keywords like "love," "space," or "holiday."
